# Group-Project

An application that will help you find songs by searching an artist, song title or lyrics.



## User Story

As avid music listeners 

we want to be able to find song titles when we cannot name them

so that we can import to a Spotify playlist. 

```
GIVEN that a person listens to a song, and wants to find out more about it

WHEN a person types a search by song title, artist name or just a few words of the lyrics

THEN the application will turn up results related to the search.
